### Data

- Water quality and hydrologic data were retrieved from the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) online database ([DBHYDRO]( www.sfwmd.gov/dbhydro)).

- S-79 and Caloosahatchee River Esturay (CRE) monitoring network.

- Period of Record: May 1, 2004 - April 30, 2019 (WY2005 - 2019).

- Data were screened for fatal qualifers and reversals (i.e. SRP > TP).

- Data reported as less than method detection limit (MDL) were assigned one-half the MDL.

### Statistical Analysis

- Principal Component Analysis using `rda(... scale = T)` in `R`.

- Analyses performed in R (Ver `r paste(version$major, version$minor,sep=".")`)

## The Data

- Daily grab samples from CES02 - CES09
  - Chlorophyll-a (chla)
  - Color 
  - Turbidity (turb)
  - Photosynthetic Active Radiation (PAR)
  - Salinity (Sal)
  - Total Phosphorus (TP)
  - Soluable Reactive Phosphorus (SRP)
  - Total Nitrogen (TN)
  - Dissolved Inorangic Nitrogen (DIN)
  
- S-79, 30-Day rolling total discharge

- Distance downstream from S-79 

???
Does PAR = Kd?

#### Measure of Sampling Adequacy (MSA)
```{r,echo=F}
MSA.dat=data.frame(parameter=c("Chla", "Color", "Turb", "PAR", "Sal", "TP", "SRP", "TN", "DIN","q.30d", "Dist_km"),msa=c(0.53, 0.9, 0.28, 0.82, 0.83, 0.58, 0.58, 0.78, 0.72, 0.66,0.72))
library(kableExtra)
knitr::kable(MSA.dat,format="html",
      col.names = c("Parameter","MSA"),
      align=c("l","c"),row.names = F,escape=F, booktabs = T)%>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F,font_size=14)%>%
  footnote(symbol=c("`KMOS(...)` in the `REdaS` package","MSA & KMO threshold of 0.5 for data suitability"))

```

#### Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin Statistics (KMOS)

- KMO-Criterion: 0.70

- If Turbidity is excluded KMO-Criterion: 0.72

### PCA Scree Plot
```{r,out.width="95%",echo=FALSE,fig.align="center",fig.cap="Left: Scree plot of eigenvalues for each prinicipal component with the Kaiser threshold identified. Right: Scree plot of the variance and cumulative variance for each priniciple component."}

#to save time compling presentation
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Julian_LaCie/_GitHub/EstuaryTip/Plots/png/CRE_WQ_scree.png")
```

- The first three components account for 79% of the cumulative variance.

### PCA Biplot

???

- Distance Downstream and Chl-a are postively correlated between th three components.

- Color and TN (PCA 1 and 2) and Color and SRP (PCA 1 and 3) are positively correlated.

### Next

- Compare parameters at the site level (i.e. PCA for CES02, 03, etc.)

- Evalute nitrogen species (NO<sub>x</sub>, NH<sub>4</sub>, TON, etc.) in the multi-dimensional space

- Explore Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis
  - Similar to PCA with some unique differences.
  - Both dimensionality reduction / pairwise comparison techniques

PCA 

The input to PCA is the original vectors in n-dimensional space and the data are projected onto the directions in the data with the most variance. Hence the “spread” of the data is roughly conserved as the dimensionality decreases.

Multidimensional Scaling

The input to MDS is the pairwise distances between points.
